          South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and
          Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for Comedy Central. The
          series revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric
          Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their exploits in and around the
          titular Colorado town. South Park became infamous for its profanity
          and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards
          an adult audience.

          Parker and Stone developed South Park from two animated short films
          both titled The Spirit of Christmas. The second short became one of
          the first Internet viral videos, ultimately leading to South Park's
          production. The pilot episode was produced using cutout animation,
          leading to all subsequent episodes being produced with computer
          animation that emulated the cutout technique. South Park features a
          very large ensemble cast of recurring characters.

          Since its debut on August 13, 1997, 309 episodes of South Park have
          been broadcast. It debuted with great success, consistently earning
          the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings
          have varied, but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest-rated
          programs. Two television specials, "The Pandemic Special" and "South
          ParQ Vaccination Special", respectively premiered in September 2020[2]
          and March 2021.[3][4] In August 2021, Parker and Stone announced a
          deal with ViacomCBS which slates the show through season 30 in 2027
          for Comedy Central, and the production of a series of films made
          exclusively for Paramount+ with two premiering later in 2021.[5]
